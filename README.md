node keeping app project
TODO:
1. Write a code that simulates the file explorer which should consist of create files, delete files, c files and open files. (Based on our format)
2. Enabling text visualisation and obviously insertion.
3. Actualising short cuts (any special combinations of our choice, most likely windows short cuts).
4. In-file features using key-characters. (including objects and all).
